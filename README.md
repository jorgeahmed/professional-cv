## 🏗️ Industry Expertise & Professional Journey

Throughout my 15+ year career, I have operated at the intersection of **physical infrastructure** and **digital innovation**. I don't just manage projects; I build the systems that make them scalable, profitable, and compliant.

Here is how I have made an impact across four key industries:

### 🏭 Industrial Maintenance & Construction
**Current Role: Director / CEO of Mantenimiento Sinai**
I am currently transforming traditional industrial services into tech-enabled operations.
*   **My Impact:** I scaled revenue to over **$2.5M USD** by modernizing how we deliver warehouse renovations and civil engineering projects for clients like **Coca-Cola** and **Lactoproductos La Loma**.
*   **My Approach:** I introduced IoT automation to monitor facility health, moving from reactive repairs to predictive maintenance.

### 🏦 FinTech & Banking Infrastructure
**Previous Role: Infrastructure Coordinator for Santander / Banxico**
I understand the critical nature of zero-downtime environments.
*   **My Impact:** I led the modernization of cabling infrastructure (Cat 6A/7A) for **Santander's HQ** and **Banco de México**.
*   **My Approach:** I implemented strict TIA-942 compliance audits (which I later automated with Python) to ensure 99.999% uptime for core banking systems.

### 📡 Telecommunications
**Previous Role: Lead Project Manager for AT&T / Integra**
I know how to manage logistics at a massive scale.
*   **My Impact:** I oversaw the deployment of **1,000 km of fiber optic** infrastructure across Mexico.
*   **My Approach:** I optimized field operations, reducing intervention times by 24 hours per site through better resource allocation and tracking.

### 🤖 AI & IoT Innovation
**Previous Role: Technical Account Manager for SeismicAI**
I bridge the gap between hardware sensors and cloud AI.
*   **My Impact:** I managed the rollout of AI-driven seismic alert systems for enterprise clients like **BBVA**.
*   **My Approach:** I integrate hardware (sensors/cameras) with software (Python/TensorFlow) to solve real-world problems, such as my personal projects in Computer Vision for inventory and IoT efficiency simulators.

### 🚀 Why I am Open to New Challenges
While I run a successful company, my passion lies in **Technical Program Management** on a global scale. I am looking to bring my unique blend of "CEO-level business acumen" and "Engineer-level technical skill" to a forward-thinking US company.
